# About the Media Platform

The University of Cambridge Media Platform is a cloud based service which allows
University staff to provide audio and video content to a target audience.  It is
intended as a replacement for the [Streaming Media
Service](https://sms.cam.ac.uk/). The platform is a partially featured
prototype and shares the Streaming Media Service data. Therefore content uploaded to
and managed in the Streaming Media Service can be searched and viewed in the
Media Platform. Additionally, user access set in the Streaming Media Service is
respected by the Media Platform.

## What we mean by an "Alpha" release

We have built a prototype for our platform and would like to test this prototype with users.
During this testing we expect to find problems with our design and decide how to fix them.
By the end of the testing we will be in a position to decide whether or not to take the platform into a beta
phase and what we need to build in that phase.

The Government Digital Services team has put together a [document describing the
alpha phase in more
detail](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works").
