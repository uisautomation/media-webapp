          <h2>The University Media Platform</h2>
          <p>
            The University Media Platform (UMP) is a cloud based service which allows University staff to provide
            audio and video content to a target audience.
            It is intended as a replacement for the
            <a target="_blank" href="https://sms.cam.ac.uk/">Streaming Media Service</a> (SMS).
            The platform is a partially featured prototype and shares the SMS data.
            So content uploaded to and managed in the SMS can be searched and viewed in the UMP.
            Additionally, user access set in the SMS is respected by the UMP.
          </p>
          <h2>What we mean by an <b>Alpha</b> release</h2>
          <p>
            We have built a prototype for our platform and would like to test this prototype with users.
            During this testing we expect to find problems with our design and decide how to fix them.
            By the end of the testing we will be in a position to decide whether or not to take the platform into a beta
            phase and what we need to build in that phase.
